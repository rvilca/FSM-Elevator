# FSM-Elevator

Using Quartus Prime Lite and Modelsim, I programmed and simulated a Finite State Machine Elevator Controller which follows input from various floors. Set to open only for clock cycles after reaching the designated floor and receptive to resets for maintenance. Submitted as final project for _Digital Design Using Verilog_ class at CCNY.
